Logs Analysis
Uses SQL to answer the following questions based on the information found on the PostgreSQL database news.

    1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

    2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.

    3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

Getting Started
This project consists of these files: logs_analysis.py and create_views.sql. By running logs_analysis.py on the command line or terminal the program will print the answers to the above questions.

create_views.sql contains the following views: topThree, pathViews, authorViews, errorViews, and allViews. These were created with the following statements:

    create view topThree (path, num) as select
        substring(path,10, length(path)), count(*) as num
        from log where path != '/' group by path
        order by num desc limit 3;

    create view pathViews (path, num) as
        select substring(path,10, length(path)), count(*) as num from
        log group by path order by num desc;

    create view authorViews (name, views) as
        select authors.name, pathViews.num from articles,
        pathViews, authors where articles.slug = pathViews.path and
        articles.author = authors.id order by pathViews.num desc;

    create view errorViews (time, num) as
        select to_char(time,'Mon, DD YYYY'), count(*)
        from log where status != '200 OK' group by to_char(time,'Mon, DD YYYY');

    create view allViews (time, num) as
        select to_char(time,'Mon, DD YYYY'), count(*)
        from log group by to_char(time,'Mon, DD YYYY');
